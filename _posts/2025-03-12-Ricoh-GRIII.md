Ricoh GRIII is a great example of what phenomenal product clarity looks like. The Ricoh gr really puts all these so-called pocketable cameras to shame. 

A huge part of product clarity is simply good prioritization of constraints and if your product tradeoffs match the tradeoffs your target customers would happily make, too.

If the camera doesn't fit your jeans front pocket, it is not pocketable. and you should get rid of the size constraint entirely if you can't get it to pocketable size. it doesn't matter. put the viewfinder in there.

The ricoh feels like it is designed by a veteran street photographer. the sigma bf feels like it is designed by someone who spends most of their hours on pinterest and has never held a camera in their life, let alone use it regularly.

I'll stop here. the ricoh deserves a detailed write up. won't do justice to it otherwise.

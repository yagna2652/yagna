Architectural order is created when the organization of parts makes visible
their relationships to each other and the structure as a whole. When these
relationships are perceived as mutually reinforcing and contributing to the
singular nature of the whole, then a conceptual order existsâ€”an order that
may well be more enduring than transient perceptual visions.

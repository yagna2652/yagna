[Ultrahuman](https://www.ultrahuman.com/)(Jan'24 - Now)

Our team at Ultrahuman has passed many milestones in 2024: by year-end, we have $6.8 million in direct website sales, along with an additional $414,000 in creator-driven Amazon sales. We closed December with a solid $2.9 million in revenue. Without any special offers, the surge from Black Friday content and seasonal fitness/gifting trends boosted our Daily Revenue Run Rate (DRR) 170% from October, our last non-promo month. But this was not the case in Jan â€™24. We were celebrating our first-ever $250,000 month with a daily revenue of $7,500.

This was our hypothesis:

> Scale is a byproduct of repetitions.

We had a problem to solve: How do you match Prateek's((https://www.linkedin.com/in/prateek-kumar-047414192/)) consistency across our entire team?

Our targets were clear - with a 10% conversion rate and 500 monthly sign-ups needed, we had to reach 5,000 prospects each month. That meant 240 personalized outreaches daily split between four team members. Sixty unique emails per person, every day, while handling everything else. It wasn't working.

I built a solution using Gumloop that changed everything. The workflow takes YouTube videos, pulls and transcribes the content, then summarizes it - giving us perfect material for personalized outreach. What used to take hours happens with one click.

We didn't stop there. Even our ongoing creator communications needed automation. We built an email reply flow using Gumloop that analyzes entire email threads, pulls relevant creator data from our sheets, and crafts contextual responses. No more generic templates - our team could now maintain personalized conversations at scale without the manual effort.

Something unexpected happened during this process. Our scaling caught Nexus's attention. I found myself talking with Abhishek (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharmaabhishek/) and Aniket ((https://www.linkedin.com/in/aniketkamthe/)) who were evaluating Gumloop for their Series A.

We also fixed our follow-up problem. Using Rebump for a three-stage sequence kept conversations alive and meaningful. The results spoke for themselves - more creators joined and actually stayed active.

When we started, tedious tasks were eating our productivity. We built a network of Google Sheets workflows and countless web elements scrapers that multiplied our capabilities. For example, we integrated Assembly AI's speech-to-text API directly into our sheets to transcribe TikTok videos, which we then used to generate tailored cold emails for TikTok creators. We also built a tool using Gumloop that analyzed and scored our creator relationships, giving us clear visibility into which partnerships needed attention.

The biggest shift wasn't the tools - it was our mindset. Now anything repetitive becomes code. That's become our team's operating principle, and it's what allows us to scale.

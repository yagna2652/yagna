### [Ultrahuman](https://www.ultrahuman.com/)(Jan'24 - Now)

Our team at Ultrahuman has passed many milestones in 2024: by year-end, we have $6,818,319 in direct website sales, along with an additional $414,000 in creator-driven Amazon sales. We closed December with a solid $2.9M in revenue, fueled by 550 content pieces and 228 onboardings. Without any special offers, the surge from Black Friday content and seasonal fitness/gifting trends boosted our Daily Revenue Run Rate (DRR) to $91Kâ€”up 170% from October, our last non-promo month. But this was not the case in Jan'24. We were celebrating our first ever $250K month with and a daily revenue of $7.5K.

This was our hypothesis:

> Scale is a byproduct of repetitions.

My question was: **How do I make getting those reps easy?**

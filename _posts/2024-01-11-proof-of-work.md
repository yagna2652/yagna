### [Ultrahuman](https://www.ultrahuman.com/)(Jan'24 - Now)

Our team at Ultrahuman has passed many milestones in 2024: by year-end, we have $6,818,319 in direct website sales, along with an additional $414,000 in creator-driven Amazon sales. We closed December with a solid $2.9M in revenue, fueled by 550 content pieces and 228 onboardings. Without any special offers, the surge from Black Friday content and seasonal fitness/gifting trends boosted our Daily Revenue Run Rate (DRR) to $91Kâ€”up 170% from October, our last non-promo month. But this was not the case in Jan'24. We were celebrating our first ever $250K month with and a daily revenue of $7.5K.

This was our hypothesis:

> Scale is a byproduct of repetitions.

My question was: **How do I make getting those reps easy?**


## Lists

Unordered:

- Fusce non velit cursus ligula mattis convallis vel at metus[^2].
- Sed pharetra tellus massa, non elementum eros vulputate non.
- Suspendisse potenti.

Ordered:

1. Quisque arcu felis, laoreet vel accumsan sit amet, fermentum at nunc.
2. Sed massa quam, auctor in eros quis, porttitor tincidunt orci.
3. Nulla convallis id sapien ornare viverra.
4. Nam a est eget ligula pellentesque posuere.

## Thematic breaks (<hr>)

Mauris viverra dictum ultricies[^3]. Vestibulum quis ipsum euismod, facilisis metus sed, varius ipsum. Donec scelerisque lacus libero, eu dignissim sem venenatis at. Etiam id nisl ut lorem gravida euismod. **You can put some text inside the horizontal rule like so.**

---
{: data-content="hr with text"}

Mauris viverra dictum ultricies. Vestibulum quis ipsum euismod, facilisis metus sed, varius ipsum. Donec scelerisque lacus libero, eu dignissim sem venenatis at. Etiam id nisl ut lorem gravida euismod. **Or you can just have an clean horizontal rule.**

## Code

Now some code:

```
const ultimateTruth = 'this theme is the best!';
console.log(ultimateTruth);
```

And here is some `inline code`!

## Tables

Now a table:

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

Logo of *no style, please!* theme[^4]

{: data-content="footnotes"}

[^1]: this is a footnote. It should highlight if you click on the corresponding superscript number.
[^2]: hey there, i'm using no style please!
[^3]: this is another footnote.
[^4]: this is a very very long footnote to test if a very very long footnote brings some problems or not. I strongly hope that there are no problems but you know sometimes problems arise from nowhere.

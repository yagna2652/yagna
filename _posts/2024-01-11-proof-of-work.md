### [Ultrahuman](https://www.ultrahuman.com/)(Jan'24 - Now)

Our team at Ultrahuman has passed many milestones in 2024: by year-end, we have $6.8 million in direct website sales, along with an additional $414,000 in creator-driven Amazon sales. We closed December with a solid $2.9 million in revenue. Without any special offers, the surge from Black Friday content and seasonal fitness/gifting trends boosted our Daily Revenue Run Rate (DRR) 170% from October, our last non-promo month. But this was not the case in Jan â€™24. We were celebrating our first-ever $250,000 month with a daily revenue of $7,500.

This was our hypothesis:

> Scale is a byproduct of repetitions.

My question was: **How do I make getting those reps easy?**

Humans are rarely known for consistency - except for [Prateek Bhai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prateek-kumar-047414192/). To get our team performing at his level, we needed to build a level playing field. Sure, having six Prateeks would've solved everything, but we have just one. And perhaps that's for the best.

Working backwards from our goals, the math was clear: with a 10% onboarding rate and a monthly target of 500, we needed 5,000 outbound reaches. That's 240 reaches daily, split between four people - 60 personalized emails each. Every single day.
Think about that: a human being crafting 60 unique, handwritten emails while juggling everything else on their plate. It wasn't just challenging; it was unsustainable. We needed to think differently.

That's when we discovered Gumloop, an AI tool that transformed our entire approach to email outreach. Here's what makes it revolutionary: feed it a YouTube video, and it instantly analyzes the transcript, creating a perfect summary. But that's just the beginning.

The real magic happens when its AI crafts cold emails that feel genuinely personal, drawing from that deep understanding of the video content. What once took hours of human effort now happens with a single click. We didn't just increase efficiency - we completely reimagined what's possible in personalized outreach. 

Something unexpected and amazing happened along the way. As we were scaling with Gumloop, we caught the attention of Nexus. I ended up talking with [Abhishek Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharmaabhishek/) and [Aniket](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aniketkamthe/) - from Nexus who were looking at Gumloop for their Series A.

The second piece that completed our onboarding puzzle was strategic follow-ups. By implementing a three-stage follow-up sequence through Rebump, we cracked another crucial code. This wasn't just about sending more emails - it was about maintaining momentum and meaningful engagement. The results were transformative: more creators not only joined the platform but stayed active and engaged.

When we started, we had all these small, repetitive tasks eating up our time. So we built something different - a network of Google Sheets workflows and scraping scripts. Simple systems, working together, multiplying what we could do.

But here's what really changed: I started seeing every repetitive task as code waiting to be written. If something needs to be done more than once, it goes to code. Not tomorrow, not next week - now. That's become our DNA. And it's what lets us scale.

- It doesn't say much. Only 'Howard Roark, Architect.' But it's those mottoes men carved over the entrance of a castle and died for it. It's a challenge in the face of something so vast and so dark, that all the pain on the earth - and do you know how much suffering there is on earth?

- A house can have integrity, just like a person,” said Roark, “and just as seldom. Every piece of it is there because the house needs it—and for no other reason. You see it from here as it is inside. The rooms in which you’ll live made the shape. The relation of masses was determined by the distribution of space within.

Your own eyes go through a structural process when you look at the house, you can follow each step, you see it rise, you know what made it and why it stands. But you’ve seen buildings with columns that support nothing, with purposeless cornices, with pilasters, mouldings, false arches, false windows. You’ve seen buildings that look as if they contained a single large hall; they have solid columns and single, solid windows six floors high. But you enter and find six stories inside. Or buildings that contain a single hall, but with a facade cut up into floor lines, band courses, tiers of windows. Do you understand the difference? Your house is made by its own needs.

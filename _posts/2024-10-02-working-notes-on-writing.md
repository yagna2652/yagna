1. Organise each essay around one razor-sharp idea.
If you're writing about why penguins huddle together, speak only about the fact that its a response to weather changes. Don't digress into why penguins can't fly, or why they walk in lines, or why they even exist.

I know it's easier said and done, so leave your first draft for exploring all the twists and turns. Once you've vomited up all your possible directions, you can select the path down which you most want to guide readers. Paul Graham does this a lot.

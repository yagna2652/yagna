Start with Pants and then add jackets and shirts. Like imagine a curated marketplace for audiophiles or foodies.

Build your authority with taste and solid research creds 5.1 Take listing fee + commission for each sale you generate for products you recommend 5.2 Charge certain annual fee to brands that want to use your badge 5.3 You can build a membership with perks once you have a sizable audience base

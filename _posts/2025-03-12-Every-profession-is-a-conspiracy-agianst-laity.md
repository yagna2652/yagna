***From Poor Charlie's Almanack***

"First, the concept of “all needed skills” lets us recognize that we don’t have to raise everyone’s skill in celestial mechanics to that of [Pierre-Simon] Laplace246 and also ask everyone to achieve a similar skill level in all other knowledge. Instead, it turns out that the truly big ideas in each discipline, learned only in essence, carry most of the freight. And they are not so numerous, nor are their interactions so complex, that a large and multidisciplinary understanding is impossible for many, given large amounts of talent and time."


*Munger means that gaining multidisciplinary wisdom doesn't require becoming an expert in every field. Instead, mastering the core principles ("truly big ideas") from various disciplines is both sufficient and achievable. These fundamental concepts are limited in number and can be understood by talented, dedicated people without requiring specialized expertise in each area*.

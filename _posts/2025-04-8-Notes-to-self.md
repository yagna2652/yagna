- more people burn out creatively because they don't like the work but the money is too good and too hard to give up. so it helps to be sensitive to these very real golden handcuffs. do the hard thing. stop and evaluate. say no to the money. build a muscle that can easily reject money and you'll be freer than most. i guarantee you. it takes some courage to walk away from good money. but if you have the ability to say no to lucrative but soul-draining work, you'll naturally design a life that avoids it. over time, you'll stop compromising and actually attract more of the right kind of work because you've created space for it and because you've grown into your own authority.

- more people burn out creatively because they don't like the work but the money is too good and too hard to give up. so it helps to be sensitive to these very real golden handcuffs. do the hard thing. stop and evaluate. say no to the money. build a muscle that can easily reject money and you'll be freer than most. i guarantee you. it takes some courage to walk away from good money. but if you have the ability to say no to lucrative but soul-draining work, you'll naturally design a life that avoids it. over time, you'll stop compromising and actually attract more of the right kind of work because you've created space for it and because you've grown into your own authority.

- Architectural order is created when the organization of parts makes visible
their relationships to each other and the structure as a whole. When these
relationships are perceived as mutually reinforcing and contributing to the
singular nature of the whole, then a conceptual order existsâ€”an order that
may well be more enduring than transient perceptual visions.
